I could stare like watching stars

I could walk you by,

And I'll tell without a thought

You'd be mine,

Would you mind if I took your hand tonight?

Know you're all that I want this life

I'll imagine we fell in love

I'll nap under moonlight skies with you

I think I'll picture us, you with the waves

The ocean's colors on your face

I'll leave my heart with your air

So let me fly with you
